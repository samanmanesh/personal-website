    "Samitone is one of my most rewarding and challenging projects, born from my passion for music. Itâ€™s a browser-based audio sequencer that allows users to create music using a wide variety of instruments. Building this app was an exciting journey that came with unique technical challenges, especially since running complex audio logic in a browser environment can easily overwhelm it. There were moments when poor code logic or the use of nested loops caused the browser to crash, but overcoming these hurdles made the project even more fulfilling.",
    "To achieve high-quality sound generation, I leveraged <b>Tone.js</b>, a powerful audio library. By carefully adjusting frequencies and pitch, I created a range of musical notes for users to compose with. On the development side, I used <b>React</b> to manage the app's structure and functionality, while <b>Styled Components</b> handled the styling to ensure a clean and cohesive user interface.",
    "This project reflects my passion for blending clean, efficient code with thoughtful design, enhancing user engagement through the use of cutting-edge technologies like AI and carefully crafted interactions.",
